# Code Signing MCP Server
> Digital integrity for AI agents with multiple provider support

## Overview

MCP server for code signing with pluggable providers. Sign artifacts,
verify signatures, check trust before executing code.

**Digital integrity for AI agents:**
- Verify artifacts before executing untrusted code
- C2PA proves who signed what and when
- in-toto/SLSA provides supply chain provenance
- Trust graphs enable policy-driven trust decisions

- Thales Luna HSM integration

Questions? connect@noosphere.tech

### Use SignPath when you need:
- Windows-specific signing (Authenticode)
- Integration with existing Windows PKI
- GitHub Actions workflow signing

### Use Sigstore when you need:
- Keyless signing in CI/CD
- Public transparency log
- Open source supply chain security

### Use Local when you need:
- Development and testing
- Air-gapped environments
- Simple offline signing

## Example Usage

### Sign with default provider (Noosphere)
```
sign_binary(file_path="app.exe")
```

### Sign with specific provider
```
sign_binary(file_path="app.exe", provider="sigstore")
```

### Compare providers for requirements
```
compare_providers(required_capabilities=["c2pa_manifests", "did_identity"])
```

### Verify trust before executing (AI-Native)
```
verify_trust_chain(target="npm:lodash", trust_root="did:web:mycompany.com")
```
→ Returns: trusted=true/false, trust_path, recommendation

## Getting Started

1. Configure providers in `config/config.json`
2. Set API keys as environment variables
3. Connect MCP server to your AI assistant
4. Use natural language: "Sign my application with full attestations"
